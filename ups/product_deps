# The following matrix lists all the possible qualifiers for our
# product in the first column, and the corresponding qualifiers to use
# for the dependent packages.
#
#  It's safe (and in fact necessary) to put qualifiers here that might
# not correspond to the current build (for example, 'debug' for a
# non-debug build): build_table will make a table file that contains
# all the qualifiers, but ups will only look at qualifiers that have
# been explicitly declared, and we explicitly declare the right one in
# create_ups_product.sh
