#+title: To Do

* Basic functionality

Here's a check list of work needed (or done).

- [X] trigger primitives message schema
- [X] build system
- [X] Travis-CI hookup
- [X] add JSON library
- [X] write sender/receiver API classes
- [X] define configuration schema
- [X] test programs spanning transports and supported socket types
- [X] test that demonstrates multiple subs
- [ ] application settable HWM
- [X] tests which emulate expected TP finders in terms of specifying
  mean and variance of some rates.

- [ ] move abs ~datatime~ into ~TrigPrim~
- [ ] change ~chanspan~ to ~chanbeg~ and ~chanend~ in ~TPSet~

* Discussion and Decisions Needed

- Decide on the [[../ptmp/ptmp.proto][message schema]].



* Extended functionality

See discussion on the broader ~dexnet~ elsewhere.
