#+title: ~TPReceiver~ Class

The ~TPReceiver~ class provides an application with a way to receive a
~TPSet~ object from the PTMP network.  An application should construct
it with a JSON config string and keep it alive until finished.  An
example JSON configuration string is:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {
    "socket": {
        "bind": [
            "tcp://127.0.0.1:9999"
        ],
        "hwm": 1000,
        "type": "PULL"
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

The instance is a /callable/ object and through its lifetime the
application may call it on a ~TPSet~ and an optional timeout.  When data
arrives from the PTMP network the call will complete and the ~TPSet~
will be filled.  If a timeout is requested and occurs the return value
of the call will be ~false~.

See [[../test/check_recv.cc]] for a simple example of using a ~TPReceiver~.
