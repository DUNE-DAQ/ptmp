#+title: ~TPSender~ Proxy Class

The TPSender class provides a "proxy" which may sit between sources of
messages and sinks.  In between it provides these functions:

- stream aggregation
- latency guarantee (wall clock)
- time order guarantee (data clock)

* Configuration

A ~TPSorted~ is constructed with a configuration object with these attributes:

- tardy :: a time in msec.  Any input later than this time relative to recenbt messages from other streams will be considered "tardy".
- input :: specification of the proxy's input sockets.  It holds a "socket" attribute which follows the same schema as ~TPReceiver~
- output :: ibid for the specification of the proxy's output sockets.

Optional settings:

- tardy_policy :: if set to ~"send"~ then tardy input will be sent to output.  *Warning* this means the strict time order of output is violated.  Default is to drop tardy input.


* Algorithm

The algorithm maintains N input sockets and holds up to N current
messages, one per input.  It will effectively sleep for a period of
time equal to the "tardy" time.  On waking it will attempt to receive,
without blocking, a new message from any input for which it lacks one.

The algorithm will determine the data time of an input message from
its ~TPSet.tstart~ value.  If this time is less than the current /output
time/ (described below) the message will be discarded.

The algorithm will also record the real time (wall clock) when an
input last produced a message.  An input is considered "tardy" if this
time is more than "tardy" msecs from the algorithms current real time
(wall clock).

If the algorithm lacks a message from all inputs but some inputs are
not yet tardy, it will wait.  If all inputs have provided a message or
those that have not are all tardy then the algorithm will select an
output message.  The output message is the one with the smallest
~TPSet.tstart~ time.  This time is recorded as the /output time/ used
above.  

The selected message is sent out all M output sockets in a fan-out
fashion.

* Tests

- [[../test/check_sorted.cc]] :: runs ~TPSorted~ as stand alone proxy application

- [[../test/test_sorted.cc]] :: runs ~TPSorted~ with several ~TPSender~'s and ~TPReceiver~'s 

- [[../test/test_sorted.sh]] :: runs N ~check_send_rates~ (~TPSender~ apps), one ~check_sorted~ and one ~check_recv~ (~TPReceiver~ app).  

Things named like ~test_*~ are run each full build.  They can be run manually like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ ./build/test_sorted
  $ ./test/test_sorted.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE


* Comments

- ZeroMQ input queues are used to hold all messages received by the
  input sockets.  They may be adjusted to cover variablility in input
  rates.

- Increasing the "tardy" time will reduce the number of discarded
  messages but will increase the maximum latency.

- The ~test_sorted.sh~ test defaults to N=2 senders to allow Travis-CI tests to complete (apparently they lack sufficient CPU to complete in time).  N=10 has been tested on a multi core host.  The ~check_sorted~ uses about 125% CPU, ~check_recv~ uses about 85% and the senders are all at about 5-10%.

- Depending on the rate and its variance of the input ~TPSet~ messages,  ~TPSorted~ may require an increased HWM for its input queue.  This can be exercised with ~test_sorted.sh~ which will report something like: 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
check_recv exiting after 100000 / 100000
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Caveats, fixme's and todo's

- [X] The "now" real time (wall clock) of the algorithm is set just
  after waking and thus does not exactly represent the time each
  message was received to the code.  This is probably okay.

- [X] The ~test_sorted~ tst will give warnings on out-of-order sequence
  numbers.  These may occur when two threads send their messages at
  the exact same microsecond.  If the ~tstart~ values differ then this
  out-of-order will count as an error.

- [X] +Tardy messages are simply dropped with a log message.  Something different can be done but guidance from application developers is
  needed.+ A ~tardy_policy~ may be given in configuration.  It is either ~drop~ (default) or ~send~.  The latter will send out any tardy message *in-band* and thus *out-of-order*.

- [ ] To access ~TPSet.tstart~ each message is serialized via protobuf.
  Changing the message schema a the ZeroMQ level (eg, by adding a
  "header frame") to hold ~tstart~ and maybe also ~count~ and ~detid~, this
  full serialization can be avoided.  This change can be made keeping
  the other PTMP API classes in sync but would introduce
  incompatibility between different versions of PTMP.  This change
  would allow ~TPSorted~ to be made more generic and not dependent on
  ~TPSet~.

- [ ] Current tests do not directly exercise the tardy condition.
