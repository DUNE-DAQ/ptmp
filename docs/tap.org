#+title PTMP taps

A PTMP tap (~TPTap~ class) allows one to rewrite a topology so that the
traffic that previously flowed directly between two endpoints now
flows through a "T" and allowing a 3rd party to receive the messages
of that flow.

A PTMP [[monitor.org][monitor]] provides for the construction of a number of taps.
Their tapped messages are aggregated and a sumary is written to file.
