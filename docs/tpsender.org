#+title: ~TPSender~ Class

The ~TPSender~ class provides an application with a way to send a ~TPSet~
object to the PTMP network.  An application should construct it, with
a JSON config string and keep it alive until finished.  
An example JSON configuration string is:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {
    "socket": {
        "connect": [
            "tcp://127.0.0.1:9999"
        ],
        "hwm": 1000,
        "type": "PUSH"
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

The instance is a /callable/ object and through its lifetime the
application may call it on a ~TPSet~ to send that object to the network.
This call may throw a ~std::runtime_error~.

See [[../test/check_send.cc]] for a simple example of using a ~TPSender~.
